# [Help] How to use the History Selector

This menu is the **Current History Selector** which allows you to change your **Current History**.

## How to change your current or active history:
1. **Find the history** you want to switch to:
   - Scroll this menu to the bottom to load more histories and find the one you are looking for
   - Find a history using the search field or the filter menu accessible through the toggle button next to the search field
2. **Click anywhere on the History card** to switch to your desired history (the menu will be closed)
3. You have now changed your **Current History** and it will be shown on the right panel

:flashlight: Not enough histories? [Create](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_create_new.html) new histories to see them in this menu.

## :question: Help

<details>
<summary><b>What is my <i>Current History</i>?</b></summary>
  The history currently displayed in the panel on the right is your <b>Current</b> history. This is the history that will populate and will be populated by tools and workflows.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where do I find an exhaustive list of all of my histories?</b></summary>
  An exhaustive list of all of your histories (and public histories or histories shared with you) can be found in the Histories list accessible by clicking on <b>User > Histories</b> in the masthead on the top, or by clicking on the <b>Histories</b> activity in the activity bar.
</details>

## Other operations in this menu

On the bottom right corner of each history in this menu, you will find a couple buttons:
1. The first `fa-columns`, titled _"Open in multi-view"_ will open that history in the [History Multiview](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_side_by_side_view.html) which can be used to view and operate on multiple Galaxy histories side by side.
2. The second `fa-list-alt`, titled _"Open in center panel"_ will open that history in the center, giving you more space to work with the history.

:exclamation: **Neither of these operations will change your Current History**

:flashlight: Perform other operations on your **Current History** by clicking the _History Options_ `fa-bars` button to the right of the button you clicked to open this menu.
